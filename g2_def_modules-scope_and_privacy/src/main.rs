    //here we talk about modules and other parts of the module
    //system, namely paths that allow you to name items
    // the use keyword that brings a path into scope
    // the pub keyword to make items public
    // the as keyword
    // external packages
    // the glob operator

    //modules let us organize code within a crate into groups for
    //readability and easy reuse
    //modules also control the privacy of items, which is wheather
    //an item can be used by outside code (public) or is an 
    //internal implementation detail and not available for outside
    //use (private)

    //let's create a new library crate using the following command
    //cargo new --lib "crate-name"
    //and let's define dome modules and function signatures

    //look at src/lib.rs file
